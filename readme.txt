Hello dear people,

with how well we all know the Pokemon-Video-Games and there 'formulars' the tools we all can use to make our own fan games are already awsome.
I still think that there is a lot more formulaic and can be done automatically from very little inputs.
The goal of PokemonSDK.JuyJuka.QuickMapStart is not to make a cool fan game but to produce a head-start and get a big but rough start of a new game.
- To be honest, I just like to explore maps in Pokemon and so I got into that for myself. ^^

If my tool works as intended you can give it 2 inputs and it will generate a ... not bad map to start your own game on.
- an image that will be used as a map ( I was thinking of https://maps.google.com/ or https://opentopomap.org/ or so on)
- a pokedex 

Here are the steps I am using currently
01) create a new project in PokemonStudio ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkxUMJ5okrQ&list=PLBCQaB3tnyNxqvm48pSC1jEESpgqw0RSe )
02) edit the reginal dex in PokemonStuido ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je9W-5tWh-Q&list=PLBCQaB3tnyNxqvm48pSC1jEESpgqw0RSe&index=6 )
03) close PokemonStudio
04) put my image (see above) next to my PokemonStudio project and name it like the foloder of the PokemonStudio project 
05) start PokemonSDK.JuyJuka.QuickMapStart
06) click "import" & select the image from 4) , PokemonSDK.JuyJuka.QuickMapStart tries to find the PokemonStudio project & the dex in it
06) you can select the other input(s) manually using the "..." buttons, if you wish to or the automatic try to find them failed
7) click "import" (yes a second time)
8) click "preview" , you can have a look at the different maps (as made with Tiled https://www.mapeditor.org/ ) by clicking on the buttons
8) you can assigne a different "color" to any map by clicking on "next color", you can cange the pokemon that will be assigned to each map
8) But remember that PokemonSDK.JuyJuka.QuickMapStart is only doing a head-start, the real work and beauty of your project should come from working with PokemonStudio, Tiled and so on
8) Better to adjust and toy around with the inputs (image, dex and the other parameters) on the tab "main" again and do 7) "import" again (it is quite fast) and look "preview" again
9) (!) be aware the next step can only be done once per PokemonStudio project (!) I do not know hot to do it again


Greetings
